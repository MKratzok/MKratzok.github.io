        <p class="post-meta">Published on January 15, 2024</p>
        <p class="post-content">Amyl and the Sniffers had just finished their gig at the Middle East Upstairs in Cambridge, MA when I approached them, "Hey, I have a radio show in a couple of hours... Want to come on for an interview?" Lead singer Amy Taylor replied, "Go ask our tour manager, Spike." I did and when Spike asked if the band was keen, I assured him, "Oh yeah, they're keen!"</p>
        <p class="post-content">With Spike's number in my phone, I left the venue feeling star-struck, excited, and just a little jumbled by the mosh pit. About ten minutes later, it hit me that I was going to be interviewing Amyl and the Sniffers in less than two hours!</p>
        <p class="post-content">The day before, I was just another Junior at Tufts University... but tonight I was preparing for a live radio interview (my first ever) with legendary Australian punk group, Amyl and the Sniffers!</p>
