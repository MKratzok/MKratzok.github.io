        <p class="post-content">It's not unusual for me to get really excited about local bands. Maybe there's something in the water, maybe Boston has a really incredible crop of musicians and a less-than-perfect-but-nonetheless-functional underground music scene, or maybe it's like how local produce just tastes better... But I think that <a href="https://linktr.ee/theinfinitewetsecret" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Infinite Wet Secret</a> is one of the most exciting new bands in the Boston music scene. They pull in surf rock, psych, prog, and a dozen other genres into one infinite and wet secret...

She was perfectly comfortable singing and chatting with me live on the WMFO airwaves and I never would have guessed it was her first radio appearance if she hadn't told me!

        <p class="post-content">Listen to the live radio interview with Boston-based folk/pop singer SARIKA, first aired on 91.5FM WMFO January 10, 2024.</p>
        <p class="post-content">I had the privilege of seeing SARIKA perform on Jan 5, 2024 at the Rockwood Boston near Fenway Park. Rockwood is a fairly new venue and it is on the small-ish side which makes it the perfect spot to catch up-and-coming local acts before they hit it big! I believe that's the course SARIKA is on. She may be new to the music scene, but she has the stage presence of a seasoned veteran: confident and in control of the crowd, yet warm and relatable. Her music is a mix of upbeat optimism and poppy refrains with a grounding dose of melancholy. And she is not afraid to engage with her fans, even when it comes to short-notice cover requests (as she discussed in the interview).</p>
        <p class="post-content">Give her music a listen, check out this interview, and make sure to buy a ticket for her next gig!</p>

        <p class="post-content">Amyl and the Sniffers had just finished their gig at the Middle East Upstairs in Cambridge, MA when I approached them, "Hey, I have a radio show in a couple of hours... Want to come on for an interview?" Lead singer Amy Taylor replied, "Go ask our tour manager, Spike." I did and when Spike asked if the band was keen, I assured him, "Oh yeah, they're keen!"</p>
        <p class="post-content">With Spike's number in my phone, I left the venue feeling star-struck, excited, and just a little jumbled by the mosh pit. About ten minutes later, it hit me that I was going to be interviewing Amyl and the Sniffers in less than two hours!</p>
        <p class="post-content">The day before, I was just another Junior at Tufts University... but tonight I was preparing for a live radio interview (my first ever) with legendary Australian punk group, Amyl and the Sniffers!</p>
