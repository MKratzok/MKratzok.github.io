            Listen to my interview with Josh Ellis, the frontman of Coco Elise (AU). Coco Elise is a collosal dreamy indie / psychedelic rock band which is both laconic and loquacious (and many other great SAT words, as discussed within). Hailing from Perth, Australia, the farthest city in the entire world from our radio station here in Boston, Coco Elise occupies 30% of the Southern Hemisphere and they have their sights set on the rest of the world!

What does it take to keep a venue running? Why do they do it? And how do they balance good music and good times while staying underground? A recent article about the scene may have put a damper on things... but DIY music and art is a Boston staple and it's here to stay.</p>

        <p class="post-content">Keeping me going through my five hour radio marathon on January 17, 2024 (7pm - midnight!), was local singer-songwriter Chloe Crystal Taylor. Carrying on the <em>On the Town with Mikey Dee</em> tradition for live, local music, Chloe played an acoustic set from Studio A. She was perfectly comfortable singing and chatting with me live on the WMFO airwaves and I never would have guessed it was her first radio appearance if she hadn't told me! And it was my first time acting as a DJ and a live sound engineer simultaneously! Thank you Chloe for the very special live performance.</p>

        <p class="post-meta">Published on January 16, 2024</p>
        <p class="post-content">Listen to the live radio interview with Boston-based folk/pop singer SARIKA, first aired on 91.5FM WMFO January 10, 2024.</p>
        <p class="post-content">I had the privilege of seeing SARIKA perform on Jan 5, 2024 at the Rockwood Boston near Fenway Park. Rockwood is a fairly new venue and it is on the small-ish side which makes it the perfect spot to catch up-and-coming local acts before they hit it big! I believe that's the course SARIKA is on. She may be new to the music scene, but she has the stage presence of a seasoned veteran: confident and in control of the crowd, yet warm and relatable. Her music is a mix of upbeat optimism and poppy refrains with a grounding dose of melancholy. And she is not afraid to engage with her fans, even when it comes to short-notice cover requests (as she discussed in the interview).</p>
        <p class="post-content">Give her music a listen, check out this interview, and make sure to buy a ticket for her next gig!</p>

Want to come on for an interview?" Lead singer Amy Taylor replied, "Go ask our tour manager, Spike." I did and when Spike asked if the band was keen, I assured him, "Oh yeah, they're keen!"</p>
        <p class="post-content">With Spike's number in my phone, I left the venue feeling star-struck, excited, and just a little jumbled by the mosh pit. About ten minutes later, it hit me that I was going to be interviewing Amyl and the Sniffers in less than two hours!</p>
        <p class="post-content">The day before, I was just another Junior at Tufts University... but tonight I was preparing for a live radio interview (my first ever) with legendary Australian punk group, Amyl and the Sniffers!</p>
